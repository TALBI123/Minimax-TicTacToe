# Minimax-TicTacToe
TicTacToe-Minimax  A Tic-Tac-Toe implementation featuring an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of game theory and artificial intelligence decision-making
## ðŸš§ Project Status: In Development

This project is currently **incomplete** and serves as a learning implementation of the Minimax algorithm. The basic structure is in place, but several features are still being developed.

## Current Implementation

- âœ… Basic game board and UI
- âœ… Minimax algorithm framework
- âœ… Player vs Player functionality
- ðŸ”„ Minimax AI integration (in progress)
- ðŸ”„ Alpha-Beta pruning optimization (planned)
- ðŸ”„ Score tracking and game history (planned)

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the Minimax decision-making algorithm
- Implementing game theory concepts in code
- Optimizing with Alpha-Beta pruning
- TypeScript development practices

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- HTML5/CSS3
- Minimax Algorithm
- (Planned) Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToe-Minimax.git
