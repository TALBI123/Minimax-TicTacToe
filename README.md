## 🚧 Project Status: In Development

This project is currently **incomplete** and serves as a learning implementation of the Minimax algorithm. The basic structure is in place, but several features are still being developed.

## Current Implementation

- ✅ Basic game board and UI
- ✅ Minimax algorithm framework
- ✅ Player vs Player functionality
- 🔄 Minimax AI integration (in progress)
- 🔄 Alpha-Beta pruning optimization (planned)
- 🔄 Score tracking and game history (planned)

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the Minimax decision-making algorithm
- Implementing game theory concepts in code
- Optimizing with Alpha-Beta pruning
- TypeScript development practices

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- HTML5/CSS3
- Minimax Algorithm
- (Planned) Alpha-Beta Pruning
